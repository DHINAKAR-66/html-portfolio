<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I'm Dhinakar! I'm a curious and hands-on person with a strong interest in technology, business, and storytelling. I run an areca plate manufacturing unit, showing my passion for entrepreneurship and sustainable products. I'm also a student, currently exploring maths (like Fourier and Z-transforms) and improving my technical English communication.</p>

<p>I enjoy learning things in simple ways—whether it’s understanding complex finance terms like CGST, dividends, and NAV, or exploring the logic behind coding problems using binary search, sorting, and string functions in Python.</p>

<p>Outside of studies and work, I’m a big fan of TV shows like Modern Family and Game of Thrones, often digging into character arcs and iconic scenes. I also stay updated with current topics, from stock market trends to chess news, and I like breaking down concepts like integrity, hypocrisy, or market coupling into everyday language.</p>

<p>I'm detail-oriented, thoughtful, and love figuring out how things work—whether it’s a Britelite torch, banking systems, or file path structures in HTML.</p>

<p>Let’s just say: If I don’t know something, I’ll ask, learn, and master it.</p>
